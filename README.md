# data-science-lectures
Welcome to the course! This semester, we will focus on text analysis and how we can (1) think about, find, and use text as a data point, (2) use Python, NLTK, and SpaCy to create neat datasets, (3) and create projects which could be a springboard for a thesis in the future.

We will also talk about more advanced concepts like natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLM), and the advancement of AI in the past couple of years. It won't necessarily be our sole focus, but it is probably one of the reasons you are attending this course. 

I organized the course around Google Colab (GC), requiring you to have a Google account. The main reason for using this platform is that it will improve accessibility and reduce the headache of understanding and building Python environments. This way, you will use and run all your code from any computer without having specific hardware or installing a specific software. Believe me, some students sometimes had this type of problem even a week before their submission dates!

Every week, you will find two GC notebooks; the first we will use during our course, and the second is a short, optional homework that will boost your understanding if you opt-in. Besides the notebooks, I will post links and resources that should advance you further in that specific topic, I highly recommend checking them out.
