# Data Science: S 2024 - Text as Data
Welcome to the course! This semester, we will focus on text analysis and how we can (1) think about, find, and use text as a data point, (2) use Python, NLTK, and SpaCy to create neat datasets, (3) and create projects which could be a springboard for a thesis in the future.

We will also talk about more advanced concepts like natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLM), and the advancement of AI in the past couple of years. It won't necessarily be our sole focus, but it is probably one of the reasons you are attending this course. 

I organized the course around Google Colab (GC), requiring you to have a Google account. The main reason for using this platform is that it will improve accessibility and reduce the headache of understanding and building Python environments. This way, you will use and run all your code from any computer without having specific hardware or installing a specific software. Believe me, some students sometimes had this type of problem even a week before their submission dates!

Every week, you will find two GC notebooks; the first we will use during our course, and the second is a short, optional homework that will boost your understanding if you opt-in. Besides the notebooks, I will post links and resources that should advance you further in that specific topic, I highly recommend checking them out.

### Week 1
Welcome to Week 1. This week, we will talk about our course in general and start with the basics of Python, the programming language we will use throughout this course. An up-to-date syllabus and administrative and organizational information can be found here.

Here are some other resources that will be helpful to you:

[PyFlo](https://pyflo.net/): A beginner guide recommended by python.org. I recommend such resources more than video tutorials, as you are more inclined to revisit them and complete small projects.

[Getting Started with Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html): Pandas library will be our primary tool when dealing with data, which is also an industry standard. The guide on their website is quite welcoming.

[Pandas Compared to R](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_r.html) \& [Pandas Compared to Stata](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_stata.html): Most of you have already worked with R or Stata, so here are two links to make your life easier.

### Final Project
Your final project will be 75 \% of your grade overall, 15 \% being the presentations you will hold during the last two weeks, and 60 \% the final submission. Here is some additional information that might be useful for you.

#### Presentations

The presentations are aimed to help you and me in two ways. First, I require you to think about your projects earlier in the semester; that way, you do not cram to find an idea at the end of the semester. Second, by preparing a presentation and thinking about how much work you will do, you will better understand how to handle your final submission in advance.

- What is expected of you to present?
- What is your research idea? What are the hypotheses?
- What historical sources are you going to use?
- Which packages are you going to deploy?
- What is the overall workflow for you to complete this project?
- What does your "algorithm" look like? Could you explain your process to me without writing any code?
- Which loops are you going to use and why?
- What are you hoping to find out? Do you think your hypotheses will hold?

How will you present? It is primarily up to you to choose whether it is a standard slide-based presentation (LaTeX or PowerPoint) or a Jupyter Notebook (on GC).

#### Final Project
The final project will be most of your grade, where you bring your accumulated knowledge together. Our application sessions will help you understand which direction you should go. But here are some points that are relevant for you.

- I expect an entire project with data, descriptives, figures, and, most importantly, a story!
- It is up to you how far you will go with your analysis; advanced methods are optional; however, what you saw during the course is a must.
- Put all your data, notebook(s), and results in one folder if you decide to do it on your computer. Otherwise, GC should do the trick.
